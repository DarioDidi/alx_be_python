'''
    Create a file named basic_operations.py.
    In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
    You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
    Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
    Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].

    Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
Expected Output:
Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers.
When executed, your script should print the following (assuming number1 = 10 and number2 = 5)'''

number1 = 10
number2 = 5

print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 + number2}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 - number2}")                 
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 * number2}")
#print(f"Division of {number1} and {number2} is {number1 / number2}")
